Globe Mod for Minecraft 1.12.2

Known issues: The Globe render is a bit laggy/wonky in terms of the blocks. I didn't have time to make a proper optimised block render so I made do with a quick alternative. Also I know the snow is wonky. Made that ~30 minutes before deadline. Everything else is practically final.

2 blocks:
- Globe Creator
- Globe Stand

1 item:
- Globe

You can change the globe's glass colour once it's been put through the creator using coloured glass.
